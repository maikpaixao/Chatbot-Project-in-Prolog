# Chatbot project in Prolog

### The Chatbot
The project is composed of the file "chatbot.pl", where the main code is written along with the pattern matching features and write information in the database, the file "bancoPadroes.pl", file that contains all the input and output patterns, it contains both the previously defined patterns and the patterns created from the data provided by the user. In addition, there are the "vocabulario.pl" and "read_atomics.pl" files. The file "read_atomics.pl" is part of a code provided by the book "Natural Language Processing for Prolog Programmers", so the code has been reused in this work for productivity purposes. The file "vocabulario.pl" has a set of elements of Portuguese grammar and its main objective is to facilitate the creation of patterns recognition patterns, which can be done using only the element category as noun, verb, etc. With this it is possible to recognize a larger variety of inputs, being used as variables that can assume any value.
